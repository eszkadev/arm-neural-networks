- If you have a model and you get unexpected errors when converting it for or when using it with frugally-deep, please upload and post a link to your model file (`.h5`). Make sure to first check if an update of TensorFlow and Keras to the latest versions already fixed the issue.

- In case the problem can be reproduced with just code, please create a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) from it.

- If you are missing a feature (e.g. layer type) in frugally-deep and want to request its implementation, please let us know your use case as motivation. ;-)

- Feel free to also submit any other feedback, suggestions or questions you might have.
